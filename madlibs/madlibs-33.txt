can become a tall VIOLIN or a small SUN simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic JIGSAW. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice RESPECTs such remarkable

the Cheshire CAT, and even the Queen of BANANAs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
end when Alice awakens from her BANANA.
