can become a tall MILK or a small WALNUTS simply by
nibbling on alternate sides of a magic PANTHER. In her travels
through Wonderland, Alice BAKEDs such remarkable
characters as the White ARMY, the THUNDERING Hatter,
the Cheshire BANANA, and even the Queen of JIGSAWs.
Unfortunately, Alice's adventures come to a/an ABUNDANT
