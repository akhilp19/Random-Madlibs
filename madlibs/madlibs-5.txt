HOW TO BE A PHOTOGRAPHER
Many THUNDERING photographers make big money
photographing CATs and beautiful BANANAs. They sell
the prints to GRUMPY magazines or to agencies who use
them in ZEUS advertisements. To be a photographer, you
have to have a PANTHER camera. You also need an
STICKY meter and filters and a special close-up
WALNUTS. Then you either hire professional BANANAs or go
out and snap candid pictures of ordinary ARMYs. But if you
want to have a career, you must study very QUICKLY for at
least 73 years.
